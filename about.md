Drew P Robertson aka Sandy Andy made a name for himself building unique sand art with a hint of comedy; but now he's branching out to more serious work leading a new political party in the UK called #TheBeachParty. Created and run by a small, dedicated team we hope to change the landscape of this country for the better. 

From humble beginnings building sand sculptures at music festivals, his work has now been seen all around the world. From Blackpool to the Bahamas, Miami and the Maldives have the best sand sculpting, while Helsinki was probably the coolest place we have worked. He became famous in Australia and set world records, carving at high level sculpting competitions in the USA while building funny sculptures for TV and film. We've lost count of the number of celebrities, musicians and film stars that have taken a seat on our now infamous sand sofa.

### More Information

We are also environmental activists who make ephemeral works of art with a clear underlying message. We can make the world a better place. Art activism, both directly within movements and in the surrounding culture, has been a key element of social protest and we enthusiastically build upon our grass roots movements in the heart of London.
