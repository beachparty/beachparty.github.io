Drew P Robertson aka Sandy Andy made his name building unique sand art with a hint of comedy; but now he's doing more serious work leading a new political party #TheBeachParty in the UK. Created and run by a small, dedicated team we hope to change the landscape of this country for the better. Art activism, both directly within movements and in the surrounding culture, has been a key element of social protest and we enthusiastically build upon our grass roots movements in the heart of London.

Our work have taken us around the globe. We started out doing the UK music festival circuit, and have now done sand jobs from the Bahamas to Australia. Miami and the Maldives have the best sand sculpting, while Helsinki was probably the coolest place we have worked. We set world records, carved at high level sculpting competitions and built funny sculpture for TV and film. We've lost count of the number of celebrities, musicians and film stars that have taken a seat on our now infamous sand sofas.

### More Information

We are also environmental activists who make ephemeral works of art with a clear underlying message. We can make the world a better place.
