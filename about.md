Drew P Robertson is a writer, performer and political activist. He made a name for himself as Sandy Andy building sand sculptures at music festivals, his work has now been seen all around the world. From Blackpool to the Bahamas, Miami and the Maldives, he's famous in Australia for controversial works of art and set world records, carving at high level sculpting competitions in the USA. He's also created artworks for TV and film. Helsinki was probably the coolest place he's worked and we've lost count of the number of celebrities, musicians and film stars that have taken a seat on his infamous sand sofa. Drew P is now the leader of a political party in the UK called #TheBeachParty.

We are also environmental activists who make ephemeral works of art with a clear underlying message. We can make the world a better place. Art activism, both directly within movements and in the surrounding culture, has been a key element of social protest and we enthusiastically build upon our grass roots movements in the heart of London.
