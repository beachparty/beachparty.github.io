Drew P Robertson is a writer, performer and political activist. He made a name for himself as Sandy Andy building sand sculptures at music festivals, his work has now been seen all around the world. From Blackpool to the Bahamas, Miami and the Maldives, he's even famous in Australia for controversial works of art. He set world records, carving at high level sculpting competitions in the USA and also created artworks for TV and film. Helsinki was probably the coolest place he's worked and has lost count of the number of celebrities, musicians and film stars that have sat for a chat on his infamous sand sofa.
