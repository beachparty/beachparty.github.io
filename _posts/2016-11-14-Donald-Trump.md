title: Donald Trump has won the election, what's next?
---

Donald Trump has been elected the 45th President of the United States of America, and if you like it or not, he will soon be the most powerful man in the world. If you believe most of the things you see in the main stream media, you would be forgiven for thinking this is a terrible situation for the planet to face, but I would argue this is actually better than if Hillary Clinton had won.

Although when I first heard Donald Trump was running, I got swayed by the papers and was immediately against him. I even built sculptures of Donald Trump on the beach so I could watch people kick him in the head. Now I see it was wrong to form an opinion of Trump based on the establishment media.

Bernie Sanders was my first choice. Unfortunatly for him the Democratic National Committee (DNC) are dirtier than a tramps under pants and it looks like they will never get changed. Officially the DNC as the formal governing body for the United Sates Democratic Party they should be unbiased until a nominee is chosen. They claim to be impartial, but they really aren’t and didn't like Bernie Sanders.

One reason for this is beacuse Sanders wanted a more evenhanded approach to Israeli occupation of land Palestinians claim is theirs. Speaking at a debate with Clinton, Sanders, who declared himself 100% pro-Israel, said that Israel’s 2014 military assault on the Gaza Strip was disproportionate to the threat posed by Hamas rockets launched from the Palestinian territory into Israel. When Hillary was asked if she thought Israel used disproportionate force, she directly avoided answering this question in that way smarmy politicians do.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC, called the attempt by the Bernie Sanders campaign to moderate the party’s stance on Israel "disturbing". His push for a more evenhanded stance on the illegal Israeli occupation made some of Clinton’s backers very nervous. Hillary Clinton was chosen because she did whatever these financial backers wanted.

What's even more alarming is Wikileaks showed us how the DNC planned to run against someone like Donald Trump from the very start. They rather stupidly thought it would give Hillary the best chance of winning. They called Trump their "Pied Piper" candidate along with Ted Cruz and Ben Carson, and told the press to give them lots of exposure.

Donald Trump ended up winning his primaries on one of the smallest campaign budgets thanks to the Clinton team and their control of news media. Back in March, The New York Times reported that Donald Trump had recieved $2 Billion worth of free media advertising during his campaign and some of it was thanks to Hillary. 

Right up until the day of the election, Donald Trump was dismissed as a side show by the political establishment rather than a serious candidate because he was supposed to be nothing more than a freak show to help get Hillary elected. Sure there are third parties candidate, but this system is designed to effectively be a two horse race. I hope people now realise how broken this system is.

Jill Stein as the leader of the Green Party would also be a good President, but she wasn't even allowed to join the debates. I'd have voted for her if I was American. But if you convince enough people that voting for a third party is like wasting your vote, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Even when the majority of America didn't like both of the top two candidates, the ended up voting for the one they hated the least out of the top two, to stop the other one from winning. 90 million eligible voters didn't even bother voting. It’s actually a fantastic argument for voting reform and proportional representation.

In the end it was a victory for Trump even though Clinton got the popular vote. She actually got over a quarter of a million more votes than Trump but still lost. The main stream media seemed completly shocked by the end result, how could she lose? She was guaranteed to win. Before the election, if any journalist was to suggest Trump had a serious chance of winning they were ridiculed. It's been almost comical seeing their shock while trying to rationalise what happened. Some have blamed the third parties for taking votes away from Hillary, but the truth is simple. Hillary lost because she was the wrong candidate for the Democrats. People have had enough of these corrupt, lying, politicians. Hillary would change her mind on any policy if someone offered her enough cash.

On a positive note, America will definatly be less aggressive with it’s foreign policy over the next 4 years. Many thousands of innocent people won’t get bombed to death because Hillary was very pro war. We can see from other Wikileaks that Hillary helped negotiate the world’s largest ever arms deal with Saudi Arabia, worth more than $80 billion in exchange for donations of $25 million to the Clinton Foundation, and this money is from the same people that fund ISIL. It obvious the Clinton Foundation was set up to launder money. Is that OK? I don’t think so.

Hillary was happy killing Libyan, Syrian, Iraqi and Palestinian families. She helped over throw a democratically elected goverent in Honduras. When she was a senator she stated gay people should not be allowed to marry and she even talked about killing Jullian Assange with a drone. She didn't care what she did, or said, as long as it gave her more money, or more power. I’m glad people have realised how corrupt she is.

We are yet to see what Donalds forigen policies will actually be, but I'm hopeful. Trump is not beholden to these big money donors of Wall Street in the same way Hillary was. So hopefully this means he won’t be forced into making questionable decisions to increase the profit of the super rich at the expense of ordinary people. Donald Trump said he does not want the $400,000 annual salary that comes with the White House job so I hope this means he is the kind of man the would also turn down money for illegal wars.

There is also a chance whistle blowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange will get a pardon for their heroic deeds. There is no question Wikileaks played a part in helping Trump win by showing us the true corruption behind the Hillary machine. The number for whistle blowers has gone down recently which is sad, because they actually help make the world a better place. It’s awful that only one person went to prison involved with the CIA’s illegal torture program, John Kiriakou because he was the one who leaked information to reporters about these illegal activities of the CIA. Yet the torturers he exposed still walk free.
 
In 7 years of the the Obama Administration has prosecuted 8 whistle blowers under the espionage act. It's an archaic law from the First World War and Obama has sent more people to prison with this act, than all the other presidents combined. Hopefully President Trump can reverse this. If Donald Trump pardons people like Julian Assange, it would give him immense political capital with the public. We can all help by signing a petition to put more pressure on Trump to do the right thing.

Plus we now know that the voting machines were not rigged as America collectively sticks up a one finger salute to the establishment. I salute you Donald J Trump with my finger held high, may your deeds be better than half the mad shit you promised. You don’t need a wall, you don’t need to persecute all muslims, you need to support ordinary people and fight the rights of your citizens. Good luck Mr President-Elect, and please try not to blow up the world.

I hope this election result will show you how abominable it is for journalists and MP's in the UK to state Jeremy Corbyn is unelectable. Fuck the lying press, fuck the establishment, anyone can be President. You just need dogged determination, drive and about a billion pounds in the bank.
