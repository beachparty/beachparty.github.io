title: Donald Trump has won, how should I feel?
---

Donald Trump has been elected the 45th President of the United States of America, and if you like it or not, he will soon be the most powerful man in the world. If you believe most of the things you see in the main stream media, you would be forgiven for thinking this is a terrible situation for the planet to face, but I would argue this is actually better than having Hillary in charge.

I will admit that when I first heard Donald Trump was running, I got swayed by the papers and was immediately against him. I even built sculptures of Donald Trump on my beach just to watch people kick him in the head. Now I see it was wrong to form an opinion of Donald Trump based on the establishment media.

Bernie Sanders was my first choice. Unfortunatly for him the Democratic National Committee (DNC) are dirtier than a tramps under pants, and it looks like they will never change. Officially the DNC as the formal governing body for the United Sates Democratic Party and clain to be unbiased and impartial until a nominee is chosen. These are lies, and they didn't like Bernie Sanders.

One reason for this is beacuse Sanders wanted a more evenhanded approach to Israeli occupation of land I believe they stole from the Palestinians. Speaking at a debate with Clinton, Sanders, who declared himself 100% pro-Israel, said that Israel’s 2014 military assault on the Gaza Strip was disproportionate to the threat posed by Hamas rockets launched from the Palestinian territory. When Hillary was asked if she thought Israel used disproportionate force, she tactfully avoided answering this question, in that smarmy way politicians often do to avoid telling the truth.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the DNC, called the attempt by the Bernie Sanders campaign to moderate the party’s stance on Israel "disturbing". His push for a more evenhanded stance on the illegal Israeli occupation made some of Clinton’s backers very nervous. Hillary Clinton was chosen because she would do whatever the financial backers wanted. This is not a admirable quality for a public servent in high office.

So the DNC rigged the primaries to get rid of Sanders by deciding who was allowed to vote. But what's even more alarming is Wikileaks showed us how they had planned to run against someone like Donald Trump from the very start. They rather stupidly thought it would give Hillary the best chance of winning. They called Trump their "Pied Piper" candidate along with Ted Cruz and Ben Carson, and told the press to give them lots of exposure.

Donald Trump ended up winning his primaries on one of the smallest campaign budgets thanks to the Clinton team and their influence of the establishment news media. Back in March, The New York Times reported that Donald Trump had recieved $2 Billion worth of free media advertising during his campaign and some of it was thanks to Hillary.

Right up until the day of the election, Donald Trump was dismissed as a side show by the political establishment rather than a serious candidate because he was supposed to be nothing more than a freak show to help get Hillary elected. Sure there are third parties candidate, but this system is designed to effectively be a two horse race. I hope people now realise how broken and undemocratic this system is.

Jill Stein as the leader of the Green Party would also be a good President. Her policies on Education, Climate, Economy, Health care, Immigration, Foreign policy, Criminal justice, and Marijuana would be fantastic for everybody. Yet Jill wasn't even allowed to join the TV debates. Even when the majority of America didn't like both of the top two candidates, they were convinced that voting for a third party was like wasting your vote so people ended up voting for the one they hated the least out of the top two. 

In the end it was a victory for Trump even though Clinton got the popular vote. She actually got over a quarter of a million more votes than Trump and still lost. It’s actually a fantastic argument for voting reform and proportional representation. 

On a positive note, America will probably be less aggressive with it’s foreign policies under Trump. Many thousands of innocent people won’t get bombed to death because Hillary was very pro war. We can see from other Wikileaks that Hillary helped negotiate the world’s largest ever arms deal with Saudi Arabia, worth more than $80 billion in exchange for donations of $25 million to the Clinton Foundation, and this money is from the same people that fund ISIL. This means, the same Saudi Arabia and Qatar governments funding Hillary Clinton also fund the Islamic State terrorists who have sworn to invade Europe and defeat the United States. Who knows what conditions were attached to these donations.

We know Hillary was happy killing Libyan, Syrian, Iraqi and Palestinian families. She helped over throw a democratically elected goverent in Honduras. When she was a senator she stated gay people should not be allowed to marry and she even talked about killing Jullian Assange with a drone. She didn't care what she did, or said, as long as it gave her more money, or more power. She could have even started World War Three with her actions against Russia. Now Putin was on of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump, the planet feels a little bit safer.

We are yet to see what Donalds forigen policies will actually be, but I'm hopeful. Trump is not beholden to the arms manufactures and big money donors of Wall Street in the same way Hillary was. So hopefully this means he won’t be forced into making questionable decisions and starting more illegal wars to increase the profit of some super rich sociopath. Donald Trump said he does not want the $400,000 annual salary that comes with the White House job so I hope this means he is not in this exclusivly for the money.

Perhaps now there is even a chance whistle blowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange will get pardoned for their heroic deeds. There is no question Wikileaks played a part in helping Trump win by showing us the true corruption behind the Hillary machine. And the number for whistle blowers has gone down recently which is sad, because they actually help make the world a better place. It’s awful that only one person went to prison involved with the CIA’s illegal torture program, John Kiriakou because he was the one who leaked the information to reporters about illegal activities of the CIA. Yet the torturers he exposed still walk free. This is not justice. 
 
In 7 years of the the Obama Administration has prosecuted 8 whistle blowers under the espionage act. It's an archaic law from the First World War and Obama has sent more people to prison with this act, than all the other presidents combined. Hopefully President Trump can reverse this. If Donald Trump pardons people like Julian Assange, it would give him immense political capital with the public. We can all hope and help by signing a petition to put more pressure on Trump to do the right thing.

I was happy to see America collectively raise a one finger salute to the establishment as they turned their back on Hillary so I too, salute you, Donald J Trump, with my finger held high. Don't get swayed by corruption or start dropping bombs on hospitals like Obama. You don't need a fucking wall. Muslims are good people. Stay away from exxcessive pussy grabbing and just try to do things for the right reasons. Avoid selling out like the Clintons if you can. Seriously, I wish you luck Mr President-Elect, I think you will make a more honourable leader than Hillary ever could, but whatever you do, please try not to blow up the world.

I hope this election result makes it clear how abominable it is when journalists and MP's state Jeremy Corbyn is unelectable.
