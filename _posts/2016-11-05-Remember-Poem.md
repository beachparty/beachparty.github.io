title: Remember Remember the 5th of November
---

Remember, remember! 
It's fucking November, 
America's losing the plot;
And that is the reason
Their election season
Will never be forgot!
You see Trump is a Twat, he’s a rich Plutocratic
And half of a rigged two horse race.
Then there’s Clinton the Cunt, standing slightly in front,
Corrupt? She's a fucking disgrace! 
They lie, and they cheat, while they fight for this seat,
In the White House to rule the land.
What a terrible choice,
It's not even a real choice,
Just a cunt and a prick with small hands.


I’m conducting this poll, now we’re stuck in a hole;
Which Kool Aid for you is more fitting?
Chose Pepsi or Coke, but this test is a joke 
As both of the sodas have shit in.
I present them to you, and ask, what will you do
Now it's clear there's diarrhoea in both drinks?
Literally coke in a glass, mixed with poo from my ass.
Would you happily drink one, you think?


Remember, remember!
This fucking November, 
We don’t have to swallow that shit anymore.
Trump is a twat, he's a dick Plutocratic;
And Clinton’s a puppet we call the “War Whore".
Now Guy Fawkes was a man with a possible plan
to help sort out this problem we all face today.
He’d say, “Blow them both up, ‘cos I just didn’t give a fuck!"
Yes if Guy Fawkes came back, he’d shout, “SEE YOU NEXT TUESDAY! 
CUNTS!!!”

### drops the mic
#### cunts blow up


Everybody else lives happily ever after. 


## The End


A short poem by Drew P 

Tuesday is Election day, Good speed and good luck.
I hope the War Whore loses, not the rich orange Fuck.
