<p>Remember, remember! </p>
<p>It's fucking November, </p>
<p>America's losing the plot;</p>
<p>And that is the reason</p>
<p>Their election season</p>
<p>Will never be forgot!</p>
<p>You see Trump is a Twat, he’s a rich orange pratt,</p>
<p>And half of a rigged two horse race.</p>
<p>But Clinton the Cunt, running slightly in front,</p>
<p>Is corrupt, she's a fucking disgrace! </p><!--more-->
<p>They lie, and they cheat, while they fight for this seat,</p>
<p>In the White House to rule the land.</p>
<p>What a terrible choice,</p>
<p>It's not even a real choice,</p>
<p>Just a cunt and a prick with small hands.</p>


<p>I’m conducting this poll, now we’re stuck in a hole;</p>
<p>Which Kool Aid for you is more fitting?</p>
<p>Chose Pepsi or Coke, but this test is a joke</p> 
<p>As both of the sodas have shit in.</p>
<p>I present them to you, and ask, what will you do</p>
<p>Now it's clear there's diarrhoea in both drinks?</p>
<p>Literally coke in a glass, mixed with poo from my ass.</p>
<p>Would you happily drink one, you think?</p>


<p>Remember, remember!</p>
<p>This fucking November, </p>
<p>We don’t have to swallow that shit anymore.</p>
<p>Trump is a twat, probably a Plutocratic;</p>
<p>And Clinton’s a puppet we call the “War Whore".</p> 
<p>Now Guy Fawkes was a man with a possible plan</p>
<p>to help sort out this problem we all face today.</p>
<p>He’d say, “Blow them both up, ‘cos I just didn’t give a fuck!"</p>
<p>Yes if Guy Fawkes came back, he’d shout, “SEE YOU NEXT TUESDAY!" </p>
<p>"CUNTS!!!"</p>

### drops the mic
#### cunts blow up

<p>Everybody else lives happily ever after. </p>
<p>Unless we all die, hearing Hillarys laughter.</p>

<p>Because this Tuesdays the election day, which is scary to me.</p>
<p>If that War Whore bitch wins, she could start World War Three.</p> 

<p>Thank you for visiting our new press website. </p>
<p>Good morning, good evening, good luck and good night.</p> 

## The End
