title: Donald Trump has won the election, what's next?
---

Donald Trump has been elected the 45th President of the United States of America, and if you like it or not, he will soon be the most powerful man in the world. If you believe most of the things you see in the main stream media, you would be forgiven for thinking this is a terrible situation for the planet to face, but I would now argue this is actually great news.

When Donald Trump first announced he was running, I was immediately anti Trump. I even built sculptures of him on the beach just so I could watch people kick him in the head. But as Wikileaks started releasing information about all the Hillary Clintons corruption, I began to realise Trump would be the better choice out the two.

My first choice would have been Bernie Sanders. Unfornatually he wasn't allowed to run because the DNC didn't like him. We all know that politics is a dirty game and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) which is the formal governing body for the United Sates Democratic Party play a very dirty game. Officially they should appear unbiased until a nominee is chosen. They claim to be impartial, but they didn't like Bernie Sanders.

One reason for this was beacuse Sanders wanted a more evenhanded approach to Israeli occupation of land Palestinians claim for a future state. Speaking at a debate with Clinton, Sanders, who declared himself 100% pro-Israel said that Israel’s 2014 military assault on the Gaza Strip was disproportionate to the threat posed by Hamas rockets launched from the Palestinian territory into Israel. When Hillary was asked if she thought Israel used disproportionate force, she directly avoided answering the question in that way professional politicians do.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, called the attempt by the Bernie Sanders campaign to moderate the party’s stance on Israel "disturbing". His push for a more evenhanded stance on the illegal Israeli occupation made some of Clinton’s backers very nervous. Hillary Clinton was chosen because she did whatever her financial backers wanted.

What's even more alarming is Wikileaks showed us the DNC planned to run against someone like Donald Trump from the very start, because they though it would give Hillary the best chance of winning. They called him their "Pied Piper" candidate along with Ted Cruz and Ben Carson, and told the press to give them lots of exposure.

Donald Trump ended up winning his primaries on one of the smallest campaign budgets thanks to the Clinton team and the media she can control. Back in March, The Newyork Times reported that Donald Trump had recieved $2 Billion worth of free media advertising during his campaign. 

Right up until the day of the election, Donald Trump was dismissed as a side show by the political establishment rather than a serious candidate because he was supposed to be nothing more than a freak show to help get Hillary elected. Sure there are third parties candidate, but this system is designed to effectively be a two horse race. Jill Stein as the leader of the Green Party would probably be better president then Trump and Clinton, but she wasn't even allowed to debate with them. If you convince enough people that voting for a third party is like wasting your vote, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Even when the majority of America didn't like both of the top two candidates, the ended up voting for the one they hated the least to stop the other winning.

In the end it was a victory for Trump even though the majority of people voted for Hillary. The main stream media in the UK seemed completly shocked by this result, and perhaps they should admit the system is broken. If this isn't a fantastic argument for voting reform and proportional representation then I don't know what is. Hillary won the popular vote, but I have to say that Trump is a still better choice than Clinton, and here's why.

America will definatly be less aggressive with it’s foreign policy over the next 4 years. Many thousands of innocent people won’t get bombed to death because Hillary was quite the warmonger. We can see from other Wikileaks that Hillary Clinton helped negotiate the world’s largest ever arms deal with Saudi Arabia, worth more than $80 billion in exchange for donations of $25 million to the Clinton Foundation and they are the same people that fund ISIL. Hillary was happy killing Libyan, Syrian, Iraqi and Palestinian families. She helped over throw the democratically elected goverent in Honduras. When she was a senator she stated gay people should not be allowed to marry and she even talked about killing Jullian Assange with a drone. She didn't care what she did, or said, as long as it gave her more money, or more power.

We are yet to see what Donalds forigen policies will actually be, but I'm hopeful. Trump is not beholden to these big money donors of Wall Street in the same way Hillary was. So hopefully this means he won’t be forced into making questionable decisions to increase the profit of the super rich at the expense of ordinary people.

There also might be a small chance people like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange will get a pardon for their heroic deeds. There is no question Wikileaks played a part in helping Trump win by showing us the true corruption behind the Hillary machine. Sadly the number for whistle blowers has gone down recently which is sad, because they actually help make the world a better place. It’s awful that only one person went to prison involved with the CIA’s illegal torture program, John Kiriakou and he was the one who leaked information to reporters about these illegal activities of the CIA. The torturers he exposed walk free.

The primaries were rigged to help Clinton beat Sanders and leaks show Trump was also helped by the Clinton team because they thought Hillary would do best against someone like Trump. LOL. The networks refused to allow any 3rd party candidates onto the TV debates and this is just not cool.
 
In 7 years of the the Obama Administration 8 whistle blowers have been prosecuted under the espionage act. It's an archaic law from the First World War. Obama has prosecuted more with this act, than all the other presidents combined. Hopefully President Trump can reverse this. If Donald Trump pardons Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, it would give him immense political capital.  

Plus we now know that the voting machines were not rigged as America collectively sticks up a one finger salute to the establishment. I salute you Donald J Trump with my finger held high, may your deeds be better than half the bull shit you promised. Good luck and please try not to blow up the world.

I hope this also means journalists and MP's will no longer be allowed to state that says Jeremy Corbyn is unelectable.
