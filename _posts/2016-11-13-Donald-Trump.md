title: Donald Trump has won the election, what's next?
---

Donald Trump has been elected the 45th President of the United States of America so if you like it or not, he will soon be the most powerful man in the world. If you believe most of the things you read in the main stream media, you would be forgiven for thinking this is a terrible situation for the planet, but I would argue this is actually great news.
